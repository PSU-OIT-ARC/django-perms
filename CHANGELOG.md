# Change Log for django-perms

## 1.3.0 - unreleased

In progress...

## [1.2.1] - 2015-05-19

### Fixed

- `PermissionsRegistry._get_user_model()` was unintentionally decoratored with
  `@property`.

## [1.2.0] - 2015-05-15

### Deprecated

- Object-notation access to permissions will be removed in 2.0. All views
  should be decorated using `@permissions.require('perm_name')` instead of
  `@permissions.perm_name`.

### Changed

- Template filters now immediately return False if they're passed a non-user
  object (that is, an object that is not an instance of get_user_model() or
  AnonymousUser). This makes these template filters less likely to crash the
  page.
- Template filters now bypass the call to the permission function for anonymous
  users when anonymous users aren't allowed.

## [1.1.0] - 2015-03-27

### Fixed

- Template filters now bypass the call to the permission function when
  appropriate (e.g., when `allow_staff=True` and the user is staff). The
  logic for this was already in place but was broken due to operator
  precedence.
- Tests now run on Python 2.6.
- Tests no longer cause warnings under Django 1.7 (due to missing
  `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` setting).

### Added

- `PermissionsRegistry.entry_for_view(view, permission_name)` can be used to
  whether a view requires a permission. This is intended for use in testing.
- Travis CI config was added.

## [1.0.0] - 2015-03-25

Initial version.
